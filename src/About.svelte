  <p>
    I was born and raised in the city of Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. The city's
    culture and mannerisms are still a big part of who I am (I hope).
  </p>
  <p>I studied design at IIT, Guwahati.</p>
  <p>
    I have previously been an intern at the Info Design Lab at IDC, Hindustan
    Times, Scroll and The Washington Post.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've had the great fortune of learning from the most talented and supportive
    people from the industry.
