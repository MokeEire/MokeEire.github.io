    I was born and raised in the city of Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. The city's tenderness is hopefully still a part of me.
  </p>
  <p>I studied design at IIT Guwahati and have previously interned at the Info Design Lab at IDC, Hindustan
    Times, Scroll and The Washington Post.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've had the immense fortune of learning from the most talented and supportive
    people in the industry.
